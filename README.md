# This is a demonstration of identifying whether a image is AI generated 
# By checking it's metadata

## We use Pillow library to extract the Exif (Exchangeable image file format) of selected images, comparing AI generated images and images taken by real human

Exif is supported by almost all digital camera manufacturers.

The metadata tags defined in the Exif standard cover a broad spectrum:

Camera settings: This includes static information such as the camera model and make, and information that varies with each image such as orientation (rotation), aperture, shutter speed, focal length, metering mode, and ISO speed information
Image metrics: Pixel dimensions, resolution, colorspace, and filesize
Date and time information, digital cameras will record the current (local) date and time set on the device and save this in the metadata
Location information
A thumbnail for previewing the picture on the camera's LCD screen, in file managers, or in photo manipulation software
